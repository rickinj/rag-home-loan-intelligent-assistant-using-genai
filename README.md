### AI-powered EMI Calculator • Eligibility Engine • RAG Policy Assistant

This project implements a fully functional **Home Loan Assistant** that can:
- 💰 Calculate EMI with full amortization schedule  
- 📊 Check loan eligibility using FOIR & EMI-based logic  
- 📚 Answer policy questions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- 📝 Extract, classify, and store data into BigQuery  
- 🤖 Maintain multi-step dialogue with an intelligent agent  

Built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **Google Gemini**, **FAISS**, and **BigQuery**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔢 1. EMI Calculator
- Collects principal, tenure, and interest rate  
- Validates values intelligently using LLM classification  
- Generates:  
  - Monthly EMI  
  - Total interest  
  - Total payment  
  - Month-wise amortization schedule  

---

### 📊 2. Loan Eligibility (Soft Sanction)
Based on:
- Income  
- Expense  
- Employment Type  
- Age (DOB)  
- FOIR  
- Reverse EMI calculation  
- Max permissible loan tenure  

Outputs:
- Eligible / Not Eligible  
- Soft sanction loan amount  
- Reason  

---

### 🧠 3. RAG Policy Support
- Loads multiple PDFs  
- Splits using text chunker  
- Embeds with **Google Generative AI Embeddings** (service account only)  
- Stores in **FAISS** vector index  
- Provides policy answers grounded in bank documentation  

---

### 🤖 4. Intelligent Multi-Flow Agent
The **agent** handles:
- EMI flow  
- Eligibility flow  
- RAG fallback  
- OTP collection  
- Contact flow  
- Intent detection  
- Natural conversation with memory  

The agent supports restarting EMI/Eligibility from anywhere.

---

### 🗂 5. BigQuery Integration  
Continuously logs:
- Full chat history  
- Extracted user data (name, email, phone, income, etc.)  
- Uses **MERGE UPSERT** to update across the session  

Tables created:
- `tbl_conversation`  
- `tbl_extracted_data`

# 🔐 Environment Setup (Important)

This project requires two sensitive credentials:

✔ `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`  
✔ `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD`  

Because these contain confidential information, **do NOT upload them to GitHub**.  
Each contributor must create their own credentials by following the steps below.

# 1️⃣ Generate `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

This is the path to your **Google Cloud Service Account JSON key**, used for BigQuery and Google Cloud authentication.

### **Steps**

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console**  
   https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Select your project 

3. Open the sidebar → **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts**

4. Click **Create Service Account**

5. Enter a name, e.g.:

6. Click **Create and Continue**

7. Assign these roles:

- **BigQuery Data Viewer**  
- **BigQuery Data Editor**  
- **BigQuery Job User**

8. Click **Continue → Done**

9. Open the created account → go to the **Keys** tab

10. Click **Add Key → Create New Key**

11. Choose **JSON**, then download the file.

12. Place it inside your project (but not tracked by Git): /credentials/service_account.json

13. Add this into your `.env`: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials/service_account.json

14. Make sure `.gitignore` contains:

# 2️⃣ Generate `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD` (Gmail App Password)

This password is required for sending OTP emails from your Gmail account.

### **Steps**

1. Open your Google Security settings:  
https://myaccount.google.com/security

2. Under **Signing in to Google**, enable:
- **2-Step Verification**

3. After that, open App Passwords:  
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

4. Choose:
- **App:** Mail  
- **Device:** Your device (e.g., Windows Computer)

5. Click **Generate**

6. Copy the 16-character password (Google shows it once)

7. Add it to your `.env`:

8. **Never commit this password to GitHub.**
